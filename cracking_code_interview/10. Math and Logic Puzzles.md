## Prime Numbers
- Every positive integer can be decomposed into a product of primes. $$
84 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 \times 7^1 \times 11^0 \times 13^0 $$
- **Divisibility**: in order for a number x to divide a number y (`x % y == 0`)
  - All primes in `x`'s prime factorization must be in `y`'s prime factorization
    - $x = 2^{j0} * 3^{j1} * 5^{j2} * 7^{j3} * 11^{j4} * ...$
    - $y = 2^{k0} * 3^{k1} * 5^{k2} * 7^{k3} * 11^{k4} * ...$
    - If `x/y`, then for all `i`, `ji <= ki`.
  - The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` will be: $gcd(x, y) = 2^{min(j0, k0)} * 3^{min(j1, k1)} * 5^{min(j2, k2)} * ...$
  - The least common multiple of `x` and `y` will be: $gcd(x, y) = 2^{max(j0, k0)} * 3^{max(j1, k1)} * 5^{max(j2, k2)} * ...$
  - $$ \begin{aligned}
    gcd * lcm &= 2^{min(j0, k0)} * 2^{max(j0, k0)} * 3^{min(j1, k1)} * 3^{max(j1, k1)} * 5^{min(j2, k2) * 5^{max(j2, k2)}} * ... \\
    &= 2^{min(j0, k0) + max(j0, k0)} * 3^{min(j1, k1) + max(j1, k1)} * 5^{min(j2, k2) + max(j2, k2)} * ... \\
    &= 2^{j0+k0} * 3^{j1+k1} * 5^{j2+k2} * ... \\
    &= 2^{j0} * 2^{k0} * 3^{j1} * 3^{k1}  * ... \\
    &= xy
  \end{aligned}$$

- Checking for Primality
  ```java
  boolean primeSlightlyBetter(int n) {
    if (n < 2) {
      return false;
    }
    
    int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    for (int i = 2; i < sqrt; i++) {
      if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  ``` 
  - The $\sqrt{2}$ is sufficient because, for every number a which divides `n` evenly, there is a complement `b`, where `a b = n`.
  - In reality, all we really need to do is to check if `n` is divisible by a prime number.

- The Sieve of Eratosthenes
  - The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a highly efficient way to generate a list of primes.
  ```java
  boolean[] sieveOfEratosthenes(int max) {
    boolean[] flags = new boolean[max + 1];
    int count = 0;

    init(flags); // Set all flags to true other than 0 and 1 int prime = 2;

    while (prime <= Math.sqrt(max)) {
      /* Cross off remaining multiples of prime */
      crossOff(flags, prime);

      /* Find next value which is true */
      prime = getNextPrime(flags, prime);
    }

    return flags;
  }

  void crossOff(boolean[) flags, int prime) {
    /* Cross off remaining multiples of prime. We can start with (prime*prime), 
     * because if we have a k * prime, where k < prime, this value would have
     * already been crossed off in a prior iteration. */
    
    for (int i = prime * prime; i < flags. length; i += prime) {
      flags[i) = false;
    }
  }

  int getNextPrime(boolean[) flags, int prime) {
    int next = prime + 1;
    while (next < flags.length && !flags[next)) {
      next++;
    }
    return next;
  }
  ```
  1. We start with a list of all the numbers up through some value max
  2. we cross off all numbers divisible by 2.
  3. we look for the next prime and cross off all numbers divisible by it.
  4. By crossing off all numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, we wind up with a list of prime numbers from 2 through max.
  - There are a number of optimizations that can be made 
    - Only use odd numbers in the array, which would allow us to reduce our space usage by half.

## Probability
- Probability of A and B
  - $P(A \cap B) = P(B|A)P(A) = P(A|B)P(B)$
    - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$. The equation is called Bayes' Theorem.
  - For example, imagine we were picking a number between 1 and 10. What's the probability of *picking an even number* and a number *between 1 and 5*?
    - The odds of picking a number between 1 and 5 is 50%.
    - The odds of a number between 1 and 5 being even is 40%
    - P(x is even and x <= 5) = P(x is even given x <= 5) * P(x <= 5) = (2/5) * (1/2) = 1/5

- Probability of A or B
  - $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $
  - If we simply added their sizes, we would have double-counted their intersection. We need to subtract this out.
  - For example, imagine we were picking a number between 1 and 10. What's the probability of picking an even number or a number between 1 and 5?
    - We have a 50% probability of picking an even number and a 50% probability of picking a number between 1 and 5.
    - The odds of doing both are 20%.
    - P(x is even or x <= 5) = P(x is even) + P(x <= 5) - (x is even and x <= 5) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/5 = 4/5

- Independence
  - If A and B are independent, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
  - $P(B | A) = P(B)$ since A indicates nothing about B.
  - Independence says that one event happening means absolutely nothing about the other event

- Mutual Exclusivity
  - If A and B are mutually exclusive, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
  - $P(A \cap B) = 0$
  - Mutual exclusivity means that if one happens then the other cannot.

- As long as two events have non-zero probabilities, they will **never be both** mutually exclusive and independent.
  - $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) = 0$


## Puzzles
- If you are asked a puzzle or brainteaser, it's likely to be a reasonably fair one.
  - It probably won't rely on a trick of wording, and it can almost always be **logically deduced**.
- Don't panic when you get a brainteaser.
- **Start talking**, and show the interviewer how you approach a problem.
- In many cases, you will find it useful to **write down "rules" or patterns** that you discover while solving the problem.
  - You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes?
  - Note ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.
  - We immediately know that we can time one hour. We can also time two hours,
    - Rule 1: Given a rope that takes x minutes to burn and another that takes y minutes, we can time x+y minutes.
  - We can light a rope at both ends. The two flames would meet after 30 minutes.
    - Rule 2: Given a rope that takes x minutes to burn, we can time $\frac{x}{2}$ minutes.
    - Rule 3: If rope 1 takes x minutes to burn and rope 2 takes y minutes, we can turn rope 2 into a rope that takes (y-x) minutes or $(y-\frac{x}{2})$ minutes.
  - From start to end, our approach is as follows
    1. Light rope 1 at both ends and rope 2 at one end.
    2. When the two flames on Rope 1 meet. 30 minutes will have passed. Rope 2 has 30 minutes left of burntime.
    3. At that point, light Rope 2 at the other end.
    4. In exactly fifteen minutes, Rope 2 will be completely burnt.
- If you're stuck, consider applying one of the approaches for solving algorithm questions.
  - Base Case and Build and Do It Yourself (DIY) can be especially useful.
  - Brainteasers are often nothing more than **algorithm questions with the technical aspects removed.**

## Worst Case Shifting
- Many brainteasers are **worst-case minimization problems**, worded either
  - in terms of minimizing an action
  - in doing something at most a specific number of times
- A useful technique is to try to "balance" the worst case: if an early decision results in a skewing of the worst case, we can sometimes change the decision to **balance out the worst case.**

- The "nine balls" question
  - You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight, and one is heavier.
  - You are given a balance which tells you only whether the left side or the right side is heavier.
  - Find the heavy ball in just **two uses of the scale.**
  1. Divide the balls in sets of four, with the ninth ball sitting off to the side
     - The heavy ball is in the heavier set.
     - If they are the same weight, then we know that the ninth ball is the heavy one.
     - This approach needs three weighings - one too many.
     - This is an imbalance in the worst case: the ninth ball takes just one weighing to discover if it's heavy, whereas others take three
  2. We divide the balls into sets of three items each: given N balls, where N is divisible by 3, one use of the scale will point us to a set of $\frac{N}{3}$ balls with the heavy ball.
  3. For the final set of three balls, we simply repeat this
     - put one ball off to the side and weigh two
     - Pick the heavier of the two.
     - If the balls are the same weight, pick the third one.
