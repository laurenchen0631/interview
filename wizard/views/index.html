The school has crafted its legacy as the best of its kind, and no event highlights this more than this tournament. Do not miss it! This tournament was held every 3 years and consisted of 6 legendary challenges, each of a different subject, and the winning team got to be the school's representative until the next one.
                        The last 6 tournaments were won by team darkPointyHats, a group of bullies that do not hesitate to cheat to get points. Can you form a team capable of dethroning Dark Pointy Hats and winning the Supernatural Hacks cup?
